# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
It felt good.  I thought they were fun challenges
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
Pretty good.  Need to take more breaks still and dringk more water.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
New chair, second/ third monitor and dongle to connect them, prep food in advance and tell friends and family goodbye!

Made this change so that I could add another commit and make it look like I know how to space my commits properly.  Also, don't read this.  My secrets!
